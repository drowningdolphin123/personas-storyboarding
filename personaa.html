          Alex is a Junior at Brown University and is a resident of Hegeman Hall. They have a very busy schedule with classes
          and extracurriculars and have unfortunately not had time to do laundry since last week. They now have technically
          two loads of laundry, but with each cycle in a machine being $1.50, they are hesitant to spend $6.00 on laundry.
