        <h3>On September 22, 2022, Hegeman Hall recieved four new washers and four new dryers. The new machines
          were meant to be better in every way to their predecesors with better functionality and more signage to
          direct users how to operate them. After <a href="observations.html">observing</a> Hegeman residents, it seems
         residents have had varying <a href="interviews.html">experiences</a> with the new machines,
          depicted in <a href="personaa.html">Persona A</a> and <a href="personab.html">Persona B</a>.

            This description of the machine will begin at the top of the drawing and move left to right and down.
          </p>
          <p>The top left element is a screen that displays messages including "Close Door", "Start", "Open Door", 
            and "Error" as well as the time left in the cycle. The following table describes what each display means.</p>
          <table id="washer-settings">

          <p>The element on the top right is a control panel for the actual settings and preferences the 
            user can set for their clothes. The following table displays the layout and buttons on the 
            machines.

          <p>The "Do Not Fill Above Fill Line" sticker is a reminder to users on the top of the machine. There is a faint 
            etched line on the door
            of the machine (not pictured here) that shows where the machine can be filled to. Unfortunately, 
            the line is
            so faint that users frequently do not see it. Thus, the reminder often does not do much to dissuade users from
            over-filling the machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The close door display is similar to the upper left element where it tells you to open or close the door
            depending on where the machine is in the cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Leave Open When Done" sticker is a reminder to users on the front of the machine. The goal is to prevent mold from
            growing inside the machine by reminding users to keep the washer open once the cycle is finished to allow it to
            dry out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The soap tray has a prominent sticker on it titled "No Pods In Tray" which can be confusing to some users. The
            tray takes in liquid and powder detergents, but cannot take in TidePods or similar "pod" products. Some users
            interpreted this sticker as "no tide pods allowed in machine" which caused some panic.
