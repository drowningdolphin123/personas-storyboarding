        <p>Billie is a senior at Brown University and lives in Hegeman Hall. They are
          used to the old washing and drying machines, but are very eager to have new 
          machines installed since the previous ones were always broken. After the new 
          machines were put in, Billie went to go do their laundry, but felt very 
          overwhelmed by the amount of new signage surrounding the machines.
